- Refactor ovn_utils.py to not return raw dictionaries everywhere and
  instead use proper objects with named fields: Lswitch, Lrouter, Lport,
  etc.
- Refactor the code that adds "network policies" (ACLs, Port_Groups,
  Address_Sets).  It's currently commented out.
- Improve configuration parsing in ovn_tester.py.
- Check and import licenses from ovn-scale-test repo.
